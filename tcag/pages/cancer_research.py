In cancer research, this service is crucial for personalizing treatment plans based on an individualâ€™s genetic makeup. By identifying specific genetic markers, pharmacogenomics testing helps predict which drugs will be most effective or cause the fewest side effects for a particular patient, enabling more targeted and efficient cancer therapies.",
