In cancer research, this service is crucial for personalizing treatment plans based on an individual’s genetic makeup. By identifying specific genetic markers, pharmacogenomics testing helps predict which drugs will be most effective or cause the fewest side effects for a particular patient, enabling more targeted and efficient cancer therapies.",
